## About Me:
Hi! I'm Tonlz.F**, a passionate **PCB Designer** with a strong background in **Electrical and Electronic Engineering**. I specialize in **PCB design**, **circuit schematic creation**, and **layout optimization**. With experience using popular tools such as **KiCad**, **Altium Designer**, and **Eagle**, I help clients create high-quality, manufacturable PCBs that meet both design and performance requirements.

Whether you need a simple **single-layer PCB** or a **multi-layer complex design**, I’m here to bring your ideas to life with **precision**, **attention to detail**, and a focus on **best practices** for **design for manufacturability (DFM)**.

## My Skills:
- **PCB Design**: Expertise in **single-layer**, **double-layer**, and **multilayer** PCBs
- **Schematic Design**: Creating accurate and functional circuit schematics for prototypes and production
- **Tools**:
  - **KiCad** (Open-source PCB design tool)
  - **Eagle** (For professional-grade, cost-effective designs)
  - **Altium Designer** (For high-speed, complex designs)
  - **Autodesk Eagle** (For flexible designs and rapid prototyping)
- **Design for Manufacturability (DFM)**: Ensuring your design is optimized for mass production and reliability
- **Power Supply Design**: Designing and simulating power supply circuits, including voltage regulation
- **Signal Integrity**: Addressing issues like **crosstalk**, **noise**, and **power distribution**
- **Embedded Systems Design**: Integrating **microcontrollers** and **IoT components** for connected devices
- **Gerber File Generation**: Creating and validating **Gerber files** for production
- **Thermal Management**: Designing PCBs that handle heat dissipation efficiently
- **Prototyping**: Preparing your design for rapid prototyping, including testing and revisions

## Experience:
- **Freelance PCB Designer** | 2022–Present  
  I’ve worked on various projects ranging from **consumer electronics** to **industrial automation systems**, providing clients with **custom PCB layouts**, **schematics**, and **Gerber files** for **manufacturing**. Some of my work includes:

  - **Smart Home Automation System**
  - **Wireless Communication PCBs**
  - **Embedded IoT Devices**
  - **Medical Device PCB Designs**
  
- **Internship – PCB Design & Testing** | ABC Electronics | 2023  
  Designed and tested **power supply circuits**, assisting in **thermal management** and **layout optimization** for high-frequency applications.

## Selected Projects:
1. **5V Power Supply PCB**  
   Designed a **compact power supply PCB** for a **battery-powered device** using **KiCad**. Focused on **low-noise design** and **efficiency**. Delivered all required files, including **Gerber** and **BOM**.
   
2. **Smart Home IoT System**  
   Created a PCB for a **microcontroller-based** **smart home system**. The design included **wireless communication** modules (Wi-Fi) and **temperature/humidity sensors**.
   
3. **RF PCB for Bluetooth Device**  
   Designed an **RF PCB** for a Bluetooth-enabled **wearable device**. Worked on **signal integrity**, antenna design, and **noise reduction**.

## Why Choose Me?
- **Quality and Precision**: I focus on ensuring that every design is **optimized for manufacturability** and **functionality**, reducing production issues.
- **Communication**: I collaborate closely with my clients to understand their goals and ensure that the design process meets their needs.
- **Fast Turnaround**: I provide **quick project delivery** with regular updates throughout the design process.
- **Revisions & Support**: I offer **unlimited revisions** during the design phase to ensure the final design meets your expectations.

## My Process:
1. **Initial Consultation**: Discuss your requirements, including project scope, budget, and deadlines.
2. **Design Phase**: I create the initial schematic and PCB layout, adhering to **DFM guidelines**.
3. **Review & Revisions**: You provide feedback, and I make any necessary revisions to the design.
4. **Final Deliverables**: You receive the final **Gerber files**, **BOM**, and any additional supporting documents (e.g., **3D models**, **assembly instructions**).
